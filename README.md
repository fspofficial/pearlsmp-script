## ðŸ“œ About the server and plugin-pack
What is Pearl SMP about? 
It is an Private SMP by Spunky Insaan exclusive for content creators.
There are 7 GEMS each with its own separate abilities.
Upon joining players will receive 1 random gem, and they can only have one gem at a time.
There is also a Lives System, where every player starts with 5 ENERGY (Pristine) and can steal lives by killing other players.

##### This is a _less buggy and updated_ version of [HyperDondon/BlissSMPSkriptV3](https://github.com/HyperDondon/BlissSMPSkriptV3) (which recreates the Bliss SMP plugin which is private) that is used in Pearl SMP.
##### This project remade/forked from [HyperDondon/BlissSMPSkriptV3](https://github.com/HyperDondon/BlissSMPSkriptV3) which was forked from [spigotmc > blisssmpscript](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bliss-smp-skript.110127/) (which requires a paid plugin to make it work which we cant afford and its much laggier, so a free and better remake ^_^)
